# Claims Maintenance

> ☠️ The maintenance container


## Getting Started

A super simple container to throw up when undergoing application wide maintenance.

_Rules_

- If the file exists within `/src`, it will be served
- If the request path is not a static file in `/src` it will serve `/src/index.html`

Enojy! 🍺
